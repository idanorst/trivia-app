# The Trivia Quiz App
Following the tutorial called 'React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]' from 'freeCodeCamp.org', I made this app as the final solo project of Section 4 in the tutorial. 

The app is using the api of 'Open Trivia DB' to get the questions to use in the app. I also added some extra functionality where the player can choose the category and the difficulty of the quiz, inspired by the choices that I could make getting a url from 'Open Trivia DB'. 

## Structure
The app includes three pages; a start page, a settings page and the quiz page it self. After completing the quiz, the player is presented with the result at the bottom of the quiz page.
